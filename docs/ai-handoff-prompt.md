## PROMPT (copy from here)

You are a Senior Embedded + Full-Stack engineer taking over **CryptoClock Pro**, a
commercial IoT display platform. Read `docs/project-overview.md` and
`docs/project-progress.md` first — they are the source of truth. Work in small,
verified steps; build/flash/test before claiming done; commit with clear messages.

### The product
ESP32-S3 touchscreen (board JC3248W535C, panel used landscape **480×320**) showing
swipeable pages (Clock / Crypto candlestick / Photo slideshow / purchasable extras).
Configured via a Flutter app (LAN) and a Next.js admin web; pages/config delivered
over MQTT; extra pages sold via Stripe. Three codebases: `firmware/`, `server/`
(NestJS API + Next.js web + shared zod schema), `mobile/user-app` (Flutter).

### Environment / how to run
- Firmware: `source ~/esp/esp-idf/export.sh` then `cd firmware && idf.py build` and
  `idf.py -p /dev/cu.usbmodem11301 flash`. Board id `ccp-983daee91478`.
  Console is USB-Serial-JTAG; capture serial with pyserial at 115200 (toggle DTR/RTS
  to reset). `grep` for the `EXIT:` line — build "failed" notifications can be false.
- Hub: `cd server && pnpm dev` → API `:4000`, web `:3000`. Postgres via Homebrew
  (`brew services start postgresql@16`; psql at `/opt/homebrew/opt/postgresql@16/bin`;
  db `cryptoclock`, role `ccp`). Prisma migrate after schema edits.
- App: `cd mobile/user-app && flutter build apk --release`;
  install with `~/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools/adb -s R5CY50MEVBN install -r <apk>`.
- MQTT broker (already running, user-owned): `mqtt://node-red.cashlessthailand.com:1883`.

### Where things live
- Built-in pages: `firmware/components/home_ui/home_ui.c` (one file: clock/crypto/slideshow).
- User-editable firmware defaults: `firmware/main/user_config.h`.
- API modules: `server/apps/api/src/{auth,devices,marketplace,features,billing,mqtt}`.
- Web admin: `server/apps/web/app/{page,login,users,approvals,store,builder}`.
- Builder internals: `server/apps/web/components/builder/*`.
- App screens: `mobile/user-app/lib/*` (device_controller, settings_pages, store_screen, hub_api, auth).

### HARD RULES (do not regress — these were hard-won)
1. **Slideshow images must be PNG.** LVGL's tjpgd (JPEG) renders blank on this panel;
   lodepng (PNG) works. Seed = placehold.co PNG; app re-encodes uploads to 480×320 PNG.
2. `CONFIG_LV_CACHE_DEF_SIZE` must be non-zero (3MB), `CONFIG_FATFS_LFN_HEAP=y`,
   `CONFIG_MBEDTLS_EXTERNAL_MEM_ALLOC=y` (TLS from PSRAM, else HTTPS dies -0x7F00).
3. Never delete LVGL's active screen — `home_ui_reload()` parks on a blank screen first,
   else the render task spins → task_wdt.
4. Never do UI/MQTT/httpd work in WiFi event handlers (tiny stack → crash loop);
   use `net_worker_task` + event group.
5. Internal DIRAM ~334KB only — keep big buffers (images, candle canvas) in PSRAM.
6. AXS15231B driver `disp_on_off` semantics were inverted vs esp_lcd and fixed in our
   copy — black screen? check that first.
7. `@ccp/shared` must stay CJS-compatible (NestJS `require`); no `"type":"module"`.
8. **Secrets are gitignored and must never be committed:** `mobile/**/lib/secrets.dart`,
   `server/**/.env*`. Always scan `git diff --cached` for the Supabase anon key before
   pushing. Token-in-URL git pushes are blocked by policy — use `gh auth login`.

### Config & data model
- Config precedence: server settings > SD `device.json` > per-page `config.json` > `user_config.h`.
  Device re-syncs from server every boot. Push settings: `PUT /api/v1/devices/{id}/settings`.
- Auth: Supabase email OTP; admin = email in `ADMIN_EMAILS` (`server/.env`). Guards in
  `auth/auth.guards.ts`. RBAC: admin endpoints under `/admin/*` and `/me/*` (user).
  For repeatable local admin UI tests only, API accepts signed `ccpdev.*` tokens when
  started with `CCP_DEV_AUTH=1`; production must not enable it.
- Billing: Stripe checkout → webhook → `Entitlement(user×MarketplaceItem)` → MQTT sync.
- Optional features (e.g. crypto alerts) need **manual admin approval**:
  app `POST /me/feature-requests` → web `/approvals` → approve merges into device settings.
- Builder publish now creates/updates a draft `MarketplaceItem` for the package slug.
  Admin publishes it in `/store`, then grants it per-device from Fleet Rights. If the
  item is `kind=PAGE`, `grantItem()` assigns the latest `PayloadVersion` and pushes MQTT
  `cmd:sync`.

### Suggested next work (see project-progress.md 🟡/⬜)
- M5: move Builder bundle storage from local filesystem to object store (MinIO/S3).
  Local API/web already supports edit Rust in `/builder` → compile wasm → publish
  `bundle.zip` + manifest + `PayloadVersion` → draft Store item → admin publish →
  Fleet Rights grant → `cmd:sync`; production still needs object storage, authz around
  downloads, and visual ESP32 validation of server-rendered layout/WASM pages.
- Implement real widget rendering in `ui_renderer` for server layouts + WASM host bindings.
- Deploy Hub to Vercel + Supabase (env wiring is documented); production MQTT TLS (8883).
- Build iOS app; finish the admin fleet app.
- Wire Stripe live keys; verify checkout→entitlement→device end-to-end.

### Latest verified local flow (2026-06-11)
- Fleet admin 500 was fixed by JSON-safe BigInt serialization; `/` shows
  `ccp-983daee91478` as 1 online device.
- Store seed includes `Clock Alarm` (`clock-alarm`, `FEATURE`) at 99 THB.
- Builder UX: Edit Properties/Simulate toggle, Simulation panel hides properties,
  Add binding source starts blank with `?` tooltips, and Edit Logic is per page/template
  (Clock/Crypto/Welcome/Blank no-op; LED Toggle has the LED Rust sample).
- Web E2E test published `com.ccp.webtest290533@1.0.0` from Builder, Store item
  `com-ccp-webtest290533` was published in `/store`, Fleet Rights granted it to
  `ccp-983daee91478`, and MQTT logs show both `settings` and `sync` commands acked
  `ok:true` by the ESP32. Bundle URL returned 200 and contained `layout.json` +
  `wasm/logic.wasm`.

Always confirm changes on real hardware/servers where possible, keep secrets out of
git, and update `docs/project-progress.md` as you complete items.
